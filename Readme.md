Hey Trava team — thanks for the thoughtful and open-ended challenge. I enjoyed thinking through the problem and came up with a solution that balances technical implementation with user experience, scalability, and team ownership. Below is a breakdown of the approach I’d take if I were handling this request in real life.

The Request (TL;DR)
"The table URLs are super useful but also super long. Can we shorten them?"

From the CEO’s message, it's clear this is about improving shareability and aesthetics for URLs that encode filter and sort state for a large user table. We want shorter, cleaner URLs without sacrificing current functionality like shareable deep links.

Goals
Preserve full filter/sort/search state

Allow users to share a link that encodes the current view

Make URLs much shorter and cleaner
`
Be easy to implement and maintain without huge infrastructure changes

High-Level Solution
Instead of putting every filter in the query string, we can:

Option 1: Encode State into a Compact String
Use base64 or a custom URL-safe compression format (like LZ-string) to compress the full filter/sort state into a single string param like ?state=...

Option 2: Store State on the Backend
Instead of encoding state in the URL, generate a short ID (e.g., stamina1004) and store the full filter config server-side. Then use URLs like:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://app.coolcompany.com/users/view/stamina1004
My Chosen Approach: Hybrid
Compress the state client-side into a short token (LZ-string), optionally fallback to backend storage for very large states.

This avoids backend dependency in the simple case, keeps URLs reasonably short, and scales with more advanced usage.

Pseudocode for Frontend Compression
js
Copy
Edit
// Utility: Convert state object to compressed string
import { compressToEncodedURIComponent, decompressFromEncodedURIComponent } from 'lz-string';

function saveStateToURL(state) {
  const compressed = compressToEncodedURIComponent(JSON.stringify(state));
  const url = new URL(window.location);
  url.searchParams.set('state', compressed);
  history.replaceState(null, '', url.toString());
}

function readStateFromURL() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const compressed = params.get('state');
  if (!compressed) return null;
  const decompressed = decompressFromEncodedURIComponent(compressed);
  return JSON.parse(decompressed);
}
Example compressed URL:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://app.coolcompany.com/users?state=N4IgzgTg...
Backend Support (Optional for Large States)
If we go backend route for large or shared presets:

POST the full state to /api/view/save

Get back a short hash or UUID (stamina1004)

Redirect or update URL to /users/view/stamina1004

On page load, fetch state from /api/view/stamina1004

Example Schema
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "stamina1004",
  "user_id": "optional",
  "created_at": "...",
  "state": {
    "filters": [...],
    "sort": {...},
    "search": "..."
  }
}
⚖️ Pros & Cons
Option	Pros	Cons
Compression (LZ)	No backend infra needed, instant, easy to implement	Still visible in URL, can get long if lots of filters
Backend Storage	Clean URLs, scalable, easy to reuse views or presets	Adds infra complexity, requires persistence layer
Hybrid (Best of both)	Short by default, flexible for advanced use	Slightly more logic, must decide when to fallback
Testing & Monitoring
Unit Tests
Serialize/deserialize state correctly

Edge cases: invalid state, empty filters, large states

Integration Tests
Sharing a link reproduces exact same table view

Legacy URLs (query params) still work

Monitoring
Add metrics for:

State size distributions

Most common filters used

Log errors in parsing state from URL (if malformed)

Planning & Communication
Day 1: Respond to CEO
"Yes — great catch! I’ve got a quick win in mind where we compress the filter state into one short string. This will clean up the URLs without breaking any functionality. I’ll have a prototype up shortly."

Day 2–3: Build & Validate
Frontend compression via LZ-string

Backwards compatibility: still parse legacy query params

Metrics + error logging

Day 4+: Optional Enhancements
Backend endpoint for stored views (for persistent or shared presets)

Save named views

Make state URL expire after X days (optional cleanup)

Future Improvements
Allow users to name saved views

Share a view with org or team

Add a history of recently used filters

Build a "share this view" button that shortens link automatically

Wrap-Up
This feature is a solid example of balancing UX, tech debt, and product polish. A compressed URL approach is fast, user-friendly, and gets us 90% of the way there. From there, we can scale into more advanced sharing or storage options as the product grows.

Thanks again — happy to chat through trade-offs or sketch out an implementation plan!
